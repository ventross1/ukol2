this repo can be a good way for students to learn and challenge themselves with python/any language task with answer code on how it should look with comments
## how to start
### the rules are simple: 
1. create grid which holds random number from 1 to 10
2. create function named dilatace which without parameters adds 1 from every number in the grid and with parameters adds 1 to the given coordinates
3. create function named eroze which without parameters removes 1 from every number in the grid and with parameters removes 1 to the given coordinates
4. it must repeate forever with option menu with this selection: d = dilitace, e = eroze, q = konce and show the grid of numbers
## if users have any problems they can use the issues feature of github
